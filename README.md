## TODO
* add rotation rules
    * you can only rotate if there's ground on that side
* remove drop ability
    * you can't tell where you're going to fall
    * what's the point?
* better mechanic:
    * you can see extra stuff when you're not on that plane
    * you can see more because it's dark and you have a light
        * illuminating gates makes them disappear
        * different gates need to be illuminated from different sides
